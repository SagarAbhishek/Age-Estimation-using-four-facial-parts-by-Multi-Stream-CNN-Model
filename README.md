# [Age Estimation From Facial Parts Using Compact Multi-Stream Convolutional Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9022126) 
 * In this project, I used to extract the face feature (Eye, Nose, Eyebrow, and Mouth) using the DLib library and pass each feature to each of the multi-stream CNN layers. After passing Through Multi-stream CNN the output is concatenated and again passes through the CNN model, the output of CNN is estimated age.

# Dataset
* We trained our model with a downsampled version of [Adience dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ttungl/adience-benchmark-gender-and-age-classification)
